## üìù How to Start the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal on your computer.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cyberzone.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cyberzone
   ```

### Step 2: Start the Backend Server
1. Go to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. Check by running:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```
   If Go is not installed, download it from [Go Downloads](https://go.dev/dl/).
3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
4. Configure your database connection in the `config.go` file. Example configuration:
   ```go
   const (
       DBHost     = "localhost"
       DBPort     = 5432
       DBUser     = "your_postgres_user"
       DBPassword = "your_password"
       DBName     = "cyberzone"
   )
   ```
5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   The server will start running at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Step 3: Prepare the Database
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your machine.
2. Log in to PostgreSQL:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_postgres_user
   ```
3. Create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE cyberzone;
   ```
4. Import the database schema:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_postgres_user -d cyberzone -f database/schema.sql
   ```

### Step 4: Open the Frontend Web Page
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser for the user interface.
   - On most systems, you can open the file by simply double-clicking it.
   - Alternatively, use a local server for a better experience (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code).
3. (Upcoming) To test the admin page, open `admin.html` (once available).

### Step 5: Testing the Application
1. **User Dashboard**:
   - Open `index.html` in your browser and interact with the features such as booking systems and leaderboards.
2. **API Endpoints**:
   - Use Postman or a similar tool to test backend API endpoints.
   - Example requests:
     ```
     POST http://localhost:8080/api/login
     POST http://localhost:8080/api/bookings
     ```

### Step 6: Optional - Run the Project with Docker
1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Use the following command to build and run the project:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Access the application in your browser:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
